        <h2 className='text-2xl mt-5 mb-5 '>Order Types in Cryptocurrency Market Places </h2>

        <p>
          The common order types of cryptocurrency trading platforms include &quot;market&quot; orders, &quot;stop&quot; orders, and &quot;limit&quot; orders. These trade orders are the agreements for buying or selling cryptocurrency assets (including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Avalanche, Solana, Cardano etc...) at a specific price range or a specific time.
        </p>
        <li>
          Market order: it is the instant (at the moment) sell or buy order of a crypto that is based on the current price of the currency.
        </li>
        <li>
          Limit order: it is a trade order and an agreement to sell or buy a crypto at a known and specific price.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stop limit order: it is a trade order for selling or buying a cryptocurrency once your stock price (a specific price said by the trader) has been reached. This transaction will be triggered only when the crypto reaches the set stock price. At this point, it will be converted into a limit order.
        </li>

        <h2 className='text-2xl mt-5 mb-5 '>Using a Stop Order or a Stop Limit Order for a Cryptocurrency Trade</h2>

        <p>
          Stop loss orders can be used by a trader for limiting or reducing the maximum loss that they can face due to trade and drop in prices of a crypto. When the trader sets a &quot;stop loss limit&quot; and a specific price for the asset for a trade, the asset will be automatically liquidated (sold) when the specific market price is reached. Stop loss orders for crypto trades are especially useful for inexperienced and new traders. They can ensure that their Investments are not severely impacted and reduced substantially when they use the stop crypto order. Below are the variations/types of the stop loss orders for the crypto available to the traders.
        </p>
        <h2 className='text-2xl mt-5 mb-5 '>
          Full Stop Loss Order
        </h2>
        <p>
          A &quot;full stop loss order&quot; will liquidate all of the crypto assets held by a trader when it is triggered. It can be useful in the more stable cryptocurrency market. If a certain and unexpected price drop and fluctuation occur in the market, the traders will not incur huge losses if they use the stop loss orders. However, if the crypto currency&apos;s price surges back and its price goes upwards later, the trader will not get the potential profit. Traders should set the stop loss limit after research and watching the trends to ensure that they are not losing out in the trade. Traders should consider the rewards and the risks associated with the full stop loss order carefully before placing one.

          Partial Stop Loss Order
        </h2>
        <p>
          As the name suggests, a &quot;partial stop loss order&quot; will only sell a partial amount of the total holdings of the trader. When a partial stop loss order is placed by the trader, a certain amount of their crypto holdings will be sold automatically when the price of the crypto reaches a specific value that has been set by the trader. A partial stop loss order is highly useful in the more volatile crypto markets and scenarios. The trader will still be able to receive the profits if the price of the crypto surges back and increases later on for the holdings not sold. However, if the price of the currency does not surge back, the amount of crypto still held by the trader will also be affected by the price drop and the loss of the trader would increase.
        </p>
        <h2 className='text-2xl mt-5 mb-5 '>
          Trailing Stop Loss Order
        </h2>
        <p>
          The stop loss price value of the crypto is adjusted following the price fluctuations of the crypto, in a &quot;trailing stop loss&quot; order. The trader will have to set a trailing distance for the price. It is the difference between the current price of the crypto and the specific stop-loss price value that is set by the trader. The stop loss price value will also rise if the price of the crypto increases. However, if the price of the crypto falls due to market fluctuations, it will not trigger a change in the value of the stop loss price. The stop loss order will be automatically placed and the crypto will be sold if the stop loss value is reached by the crypto.

          Understanding the risk
        </h2>
        <p>
          Traders will lose out in a trade if the price surge occurs and if they have set the specific value and price of their stop loss orders too high. Such a situation occurs commonly in volatile markets. Sometimes the price of the crypto may fall initially but maintain itself after the initial drop in price. If the trader has set the stop loss price value too low, a small decrease in the price of the crypto will not trigger the stop loss order.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traders should understand the market trends and try to research the historical performance of the crypto to understand the risks better. Sometimes the price drop of crypto is huge, while at other times they regain their price and even go beyond the expectations of performance. Setting the right stop loss price and value can help traders minimize their risks while ensuring that they can get the most profits.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some crypto markets may maintain a stronger upward trend. In these markets, the trailing stop loss orders are not useful. Stop loss orders can be of best use in the more volatile markets. Also, some new crypto and coins can be more volatile when compared to older and stable crypto. Stop loss orders for these relatively newer currencies can be more useful in limiting the losses. However, with all kinds of crypto orders, there can be certain pros and cons and opportunities and risks involved. Traders should be giving some effort towards analyzing the markets to make the best choice for their investments while setting their stop loss order prices.

          Conclusion
        </h2>

        <p className='pb-20'>
          Market investments in assets including cryptocurrencies are subject to risks. Therefore, traders should ensure that they are making such investments with their extra money that they can keep in the holding for a substantially large amount of time. Most investments in cryptocurrencies provide good returns when they are made for a longer period and when the investment remains stable. Stop loss orders of cryptocurrencies can minimize the losses and damages even for beginners and those who are new to cryptocurrency investment. However, waste of money and assets can still occur. Therefore, analysis and research by the traders are important to ensure that the investment can provide good profit.
