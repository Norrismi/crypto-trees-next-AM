                    The following crypto order type we will be tackling is the limit order which is a type of order that purchases or sells a crypto that has a restriction when it comes to the limit price to be paid or to be received, having a maximum price, and minimum price restriction. Through a limited order, the price will only be either at its specified limit or at its maximum. Unlike market order, there is no assurance of execution in the limit order. It is best to use this type of crypto order type when it is the best time to buy at a lower price or sell at a higher price than its current price.

                    How Do You Use Limit Order?

                    It is important to remember that even if the crypto price is able to reach its specific limit price, an order has a chance of still not being filed because of the possible orders that were made ahead of it, which can eliminate the crypto&apos;s availability of shares with its limit price, limited orders are usually done on a first come first served basis which can affect its limit price. It is essential to note that a price where a limit order is executed can become lower than its limit price. In terms of a buyer order, it can become higher than the crypto limit price.

                    The most significant advantage of the limit order is that you are able to name the price you want for your crypto; if the crypto price is able to reach your named price, the order for it will most likely be filled. However, it is essential to note that you are not guaranteed to trade the crypto. If it fails to reach the limit price, the trade will not execute. Taking note of the demand and supply to fill the order can also affect the trade even if your crypto hits your limit. Depending upon the exchange, through limited orders, your order could execute up to a time frame of 3 months. With that amount of time, your crypto can increase or decrease in value dramatically, which can give it a price that&apos;s different during the trade compared to what you initially could have gotten.
