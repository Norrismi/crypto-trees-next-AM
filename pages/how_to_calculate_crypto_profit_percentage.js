If you acquired bitcoin as a present and it didn&apos;t spend anything to do so, your expected cost would instead be the cryptocurrency&apos;s market price in USD from the same day you got it.

                <h2 className='text-2xl pt-10 pb-5 '> There are several ways to calculate your crypto profit percentage; here are some of them:</h2>

                <h3 className='text-xl pt-5 pb-5'> 1. Using Spreadsheets</h3>

                <p>
                    If you have a small number of crypto coins, to begin with, the spreadsheet approach is a fantastic way to estimate your earnings. Using free spreadsheets like Google Spreadsheets to determine your earnings is practical. You may input your entrance cost, current value, the number of currencies, and the correct formula into the spreadsheet to calculate your gains.

                    The drawback of a spreadsheet is that you must manually enter all the information you need to estimate your revenue. You must be adept at modifying pricing given the regular changes in market prices. Having many coins will create challenges and be time-consuming. As a result, using a spreadsheet may take a long time, and manually information entered could result in mistakes.

                <h3 className='text-xl pt-5 pb-5'> 2. Use a crypto profit and gains calculator.</h3>

                <p>
                    A bitcoin tax calculator is an application or website that aids in calculating the amount of tax you must pay on earnings from cryptocurrency exchanges. A highly effective instrument for bitcoin market participants is the calculator. Specialists and traders use crypto tax calculators to simplify their accounting for crypto taxes all around the globe.

                    You may use one of the numerous online profitability calculators to help determine your profits or project how much income you can expect from a deal. To do this, you must first prepare essential variables. Once you have all the information, insert the buying cost and the funds you want to spend or have already spent into the calculator to get started.

                    The gains will be shown when you input the price you want to purchase the cryptocurrency or the price you have sold it.
                    Because you must use the current currency pricing as your purchase price, using these calculating tools to keep track of the current values of various cryptocurrencies helps predict future gains.

                    Using a calculator will give a more accurate result and will help you simplify your tasks.

                <h3 className='text-xl pt-5 pb-5'>3. Doing it Manually</h3>
                <p className='pb-20'>
                    Your gains computation would be divided among short and long-term bitcoin trades kept for a period compared with shorter than a year or longer than a year. If you purchase bitcoin, exchange it for another coin in the short term, and afterwards sell it for the long term for fiat currency.

                    The percentage technique is preferred by a more significant proportion of traders on the cryptocurrency market for calculating their gains and losses. You may accomplish this by multiplying your cryptocurrency earnings by the percent rise in the price of your current asset.

                    To achieve this, multiply the amount you paid for the cryptocurrency by the relevant percentage statement. To illustrate, if you acquired BNB at $10 entering the cost and intended to sell your holdings after making 20% of the deal, you will need to increase your entrance cost by the 20% gain percent. To calculate your exit price, multiply your entering price by 1.1, which comes to 10. Consequently, your crypto is worth would be $11, subtract the entrance price, and you gain $1 in profit.

                    Knowing how to estimate cryptocurrency profits and losses will help you make wiser investment choices because time is more important than you would have realized when deciding whether to achieve profits.

                    Anyone who invests in profiting financially from a deal always expects a significant return. However, another consideration when contemplating collecting gains is knowing what&apos;s the prime profit you can gain. It would be best if you were prepared to take a chance on the results and maybe lose value because you think you&apos;ll make up with what you might lose tenfold.

                    Being so sure about cryptocurrency is challenging since you frequently don&apos;t understand how the cryptocurrency will react. For instance, you might trade and then regret doing so since the price keeps rising. However, it&apos;s tough to predict because cryptocurrency values may often increase or decrease independent of prior market activity.
