                    Crypto Market Order
                </h2>


                <p>
                    A market order is a directive to purchase or sell an asset immediately. These market orders are specific contracts that clarify the cryptocurrency you want to acquire, its amount, and the cost. Alternatively, you can list what you want to sell and the terms you are willing to do so. When someone places an order, the order is filled at the current market price as soon as possible.

                    Buy market orders - Based on total
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Let&apos;s say you have a thousand USDC, (USDC is a stable coin equilvant to one U.S. dollar) and want to buy Bitcoin at the market price. The system will execute an order to buy the full percent at the latest market value based on how much USDC you possess, but it is unclear how much Bitcoin you can purchase.
                    Based on the amount
                    Depending on the USDC you own, and the bitcoin price fluctuates by a certain amount, placing an order to buy a hundred percent means the system will compare your order to the best sell order currently active on the market. It will ascertain the quantity of bitcoin you can purchase. You will use the set price to set your order; however, if the price rises, you will not be able to buy the bitcoin at a fee already charged. When this happens, your order will not go through.

                    Sell market orders - Based on the amount
                </h3>

                Say you own a specific amount of bitcoin and would like to place a market order to sell 50 percent of the bitcoin. The quantity of USDC from selling half your bitcoin, when you place the order, the price will be based on the latest market rate.
                Based on total.
                Suppose you have a certain amount of bitcoin when its prices deteriorate, placing a total percent order to determine how many USDC you can get. The system will compare your order to the best buy orders currently in supply. When prices fall when you select to place your order, the order will not go through as the bitcoin cannot be sold at a price previously set.
